License Compatibility Check is a compact, privacy-friendly command-line utility built around one recurring workflow. It runs without an account or API key, keeps its decisions inspectable, and produces portable output you can use immediately.

## Why it is useful

Catch common dependency license conflicts using a small explainable policy file. Instead of hiding simple analysis behind a hosted service, it keeps data local and shows the evidence behind every recommendation.

## Highlights

- Allow, review, and deny policies
- SPDX identifier normalization
- Evidence-rich dependency report
- CI-friendly exit codes
- Zero third-party runtime dependencies

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zchstime/license-compat-check.git
cd license-compat-check
python -m pip install -e .

license-check examples/dependencies.csv --policy examples/policy.json
```

Use the synthetic [`examples/`](examples/) data for a safe first run. Run `license-check --help` for the complete command reference.

## Design

```text
local input → deterministic analysis → cited findings → portable report
```

The default workflow performs no network requests and does not silently modify source data. The implementation is deliberately small enough to audit, teach from, and extend.

## Test

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

GitHub Actions tests Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.

## Roadmap

- Additional import and export formats
- More community-provided edge-case fixtures
- Stable machine-readable report schemas
- Optional plugin hooks while keeping the core dependency-free

If this tool saves you time, **star the repository** and share the workflow you want next. Contributions are welcome—start with the open `good first issue`.
